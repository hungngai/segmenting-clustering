# Coursera_Capstone Final Report

# 1) Introduction/Business Problem:
# The idea of this study is to help people planning to open a bubble tea cafe in Toronto, so choosing the appropriate location by providing data about the income and population of each neighborhood as well as the competitors already present on the same areas is essential.

# 2) Downloading and Prepping Data
# To provide the stakeholders the necessary information I'll be combining Toronto's recent Census that contains Population, Average income per Neighborhood with Toronot's Neighborhoods shapefile and Foursquare API to collect competitors on the same neighborhoods.Toronto's Census data is publicly available at this website: https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#8c732154-5012-9afe-d0cd-ba3ffc813d5a ; Toronto Neighborhoods' shapefile is publicly available at this website: https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#a45bd45a-ede8-730e-1abc-93105b2c439f

# 3) Methodology
# In this report, I used different maps that could help a new investor to decide the best place to open a restaurant in Toronto based on its income, population and available competitors. The 2016 Census information combined with choropleth maps are used to visualize the wealthier and more populational neighborhoods and Foursquare data is used to display the current restaurants in each region.

# 4) Results
# Comparing the maps we can notice the majority of the restaurants grouped on main streets and on the south of the city, although some of the welthiest neighborhoods are up to the north. Also, the areas with a dense population don't reflect on the number of restaurants.

# 5) Discussion
# Clusters and graphs are expected to show the popular locations of restaurants and cafes nearby, but places where few restaurants exist may be also good for opening cafes coz not all variables are controllable.

# 6) Conclusion
# This report may be helpful for someone planning on opening bubble tea cafeteria in Toronto, by comparing the current offers and neighborhoods profiles, however it may not cover all variables such as access to public transportation or even the bussiness profiles, so this analytical tool should not be used as a single factor to make decision.
